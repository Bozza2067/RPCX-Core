# RPCX Core
So basically this is the base... framework? of PolicingMP (or whatever it ends up turning into).
There's gonna be a bunch of experimental stuff and probably bad code in here and I want to use this as a learning experience for learning lua, github, etc.

I'm using some code from other people, admittedly. I try to add links to the original code commented above where I can.
